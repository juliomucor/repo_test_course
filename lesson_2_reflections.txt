What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder is created.
It is the way that Git begins to track the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging is a middle layer between those, I can add more files to commit or remove if I need to do something on them
